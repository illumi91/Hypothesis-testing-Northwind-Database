    "We need to perform soem hypothesis tests on the Northwind Database.\n",
    "This is a Microsoft open sorce/free database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to formulate hypothesis tests such that we can get some valuable insights for a potential company.\n",
    "\n",
    "My approach for this project has been:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Formulate interesting questions-->In order to get some useful insights\n",
    "2. EDA--> In order to get an understanding of our data summarizing their main characteristics mainly through visualization \n",
    "3. Defining Null and Alternative Hypotheses-->Answer to the research question and guide data collection and interpretation\n",
    "4. Set Alpha level--> I used a alpha level of 0.05 for all my Hypotheses\n",
    "5. Test our Data Set--> Use different tests to understand the p-value\n",
    "6. Check Effect Size--> d cohen's formula\n",
    "7. Obtain valuable Insights--> Give some raccomandations\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Does discount amount have a statistically significant effect on the quantity of a product in an order? If so, at what level(s) of discount?\n",
